# MMAT-MDM Migration Analysis Tool

Microsoft created the MDM Migration Analysis Tool – aka MMAT  - to help.  
MMAT will determine which Group Policies have been set for a target user/computer and cross-reference against its built-in list of supported MDM policies.  
MMAT will then generate both XML and HTML reports indicating the level of support for each Group Policy in terms of MDM equivalents.

MMAT version 2.0 contains the following changes: three new columns were added  - MDM CSP Name, MDM CSP setting URI, and Windows OS Version. There are additional supported settings including Security and Windows Firewall settings.

To run this tool follow the instructions below:



1) Install Remote Server Administration Tools.

	Windows 7 - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7887 
		Important Note: After the RSA tool is installed, corresponding features have to be enabled manually on Win7, which is different from newer Windows versions where the features are turned on by default after installation. 
		For enable corresponding features:
			Complete all installation steps in the wizard, and then click Finish to exit the wizard when installation is finished.
			Click Start, click Control Panel, and then click Programs.
			In the Programs and Features area, click Turn Windows features on or off.
			If you are prompted by User Account Control to enable the Windows Features dialog box to open, click Continue.
			In the Windows Features dialog box, expand Remote Server Administration Tools.
			Select the remote management tools that you want to install.
			Click OK.
			Configure the Start menu to display the Administration Tools shortcut, if it is not already there.
			Right-click Start, and then click Properties.
			On the Start Menu tab, click Customize.
			In the Customize Start Menu dialog box, scroll down to System Administrative Tools, and then select Display on the All Programs menu and the Start menu. Click OK.
