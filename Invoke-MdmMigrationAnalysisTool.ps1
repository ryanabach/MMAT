.Description
Creates report to assist IT Administrators in migrating from Group Policy based configuration to MDM.

.SYNOPSIS
Creates report to assist IT Administrators in migrating from Group Policy based configuration to MDM.

WARNINGS
This tool is intended to assist in the mundane analysis of mapping from Group Policy => MDM configuration,
as there is not a 1-1 mapping.  This tool does NOT substitute for careful analysis of the domain configuration,
and understanding deeply the technical, legal, and other policy considerations in this migration.

If you have multiple domains/OUs/sites/roles/etc., you will need to run this tool on an appropriate sampling
of those to get a full understanding of your domain prior to transitioning.  The tool only runs against
the currently logged on user and computer accounts.


.PARAMETER $collectGPOReports
Switch requesting querying of GPO reports.  If this isn't set but -invokeAnalysisTool is, the tool will use cached set of reports.

This requires Admin priveleges and requires Remote Server Administration Tools installed locally.

This switch may require a few minutes to run.  Set $VerbosePreference="Continue" to see progress.

.PARAMATER $gpoReportOutputDirectory
Directory to output Group Policy Reports to.  Default is "."  These are NOT deleted after a run because they are expensive to collect, 
but in general you shouldn't need to understand their implementation since "-runAnalysisTool" does much of this work.

.PARAMETER $runAnalysisTool
Switch requesting underlying MDM Migration Analysis Tool to be invoked.  It will read GPO reports from $gpoReportOutputDirectory.

.PARAMETER $targetUser
User name to run query against.  Default is currently logged on user.

.PARAMETER $targetComputer
Computer to run query against.  Default is currently computer.


.EXAMPLE
Invoke-MdmMigrationAnalysisTool -collectGPOReports -runAnalysisTool

Typical use case.  Queries Group Policy Object reports for current PC and logged on user and then invokes analysis tool.  
Both temporary files and final output will be stored in "." in this case. 

.EXAMPLE
Invoke-MdmMigrationAnalysisTool -collectGPOReports -runAnalysisTool -user John -computer JohnsComputer

Runs the collection and analysis against the remote computer JohnsComputer for user John.  Requires currently
active user invoking the command to have required permissions on remote computer.
